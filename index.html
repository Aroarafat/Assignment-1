            <p>Among all the creatures on Earth, human being is definitely superior. Writing a few lines or words about
                myself to introduce, I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human
                beings
                around. I am a human. I myself am humble, kind, caring and courageous. I am most respected, loved and
                responsible human being. Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I have tried myself best
                to
                express all about myself.I am from a working class family, I am Mohammad Aarafat Hossain. I am simple,
                sweet, confident and cunning fellow.</p>
